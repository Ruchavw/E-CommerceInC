# E-CommerceInC

**Language used:** C

## Overview

This is a mini-project made in C programming language for E-Commerce. It has a menu-driven system that allows both administrator and customer logins. The administrator login is priviledged that allows addition of new products to store and shows system generated sales reports. While in the customer login, users can see all products in the store, add any to their cart, find a product by its id, view their cart and checkout. A bill of all products in the cart is generated at checkout. An array based approach has been followed while coding thus this code doesn't have no permanent storage of data post termination of the program.
